This is a description of the Simple Text File document format.

Campaign File
There is currently one type of file, the Campaign file. This must have a 
Campaign entity as its first.

Player File
This file type is in progress. This should have a Player as its first entity.

All file-types can have processing instructions at the start of the file.

PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS

Instructions must start at a new line with double percentage signs (%%) followed 
by the instruction and ending with the value (or values):

%% [name of instruction][space(-s)][instruction value(-s)]

The value-part of the line will be trimmed of spaces (beginning and end).
If the instruction takes two or more parameters, they should be separated with 
space(-s). These can consist of a single word or a key-value pair with equals 
sign between (key=value)

Base path: 
points to a folder that is common for all files. You can use the base
path to group files that are included in the campaign. In this case you only 
have to specify the path from the base path for each file you whish to include.
The basepath may have only one parameter, and spaces in the path will be 
considered as part of the path.

    Example 1:
    %% basepath     /home/aaa/Documents/RolePlaying/Wetherington_Hall/
    (or)
    %%basepath /home/aaa/Documents/RolePlaying/Wetherington_Hall/
    ...
    P: Portrait/Milton_Comley.png

    (Full path: "/home/aaa/Documents/RolePlaying/Wetherington_Hall/Portrait/Milton_Comley.png")

    Example 1:
    %% basepath     /home/aaa/Documents/Role Playing/Wetherington Hall/
    ...
    P: Portrait/Milton Comley.png

    (Full path: "/home/aaa/Documents/Role Playing/Wetherington Hall/Portrait/Milton Comley.png")

ENTITIES

Campaign

    Fields: x*, D, I, N, S, T, Y
        * If x-field contains a value, the parser keeps this and will replace
        an existing campaign with this id with the imported one. 
        If the x-field has a value set for the campaign, all other entities must 
        have valid x-values, as they will also be replaced. A new Campaign 
        should never have av value set for the x-field.

FIELD TEXT MARKUP
Markup in the text is used for collecting names in an episode etc.
The markup consists of start "«" and end "»". It can be used for a single word
or a group of words. Presently it is used for names, places and creatures:

Start "«" [AltGr + Z]
End "«" [AltGr + X]
Name "£" [AltGr + 3]
Place "@" [AltGr + 2]
Creature "¢" [AltGr + Shift + 5]
