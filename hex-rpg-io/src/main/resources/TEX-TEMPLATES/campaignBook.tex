% HEX Story description
A letter arrives from an old friend, Milton Comley, who asks for help. There has been a murder in the village he is currently working in, and he fears it is too much for both him and the local constable.

Mr Comley is currently employed as a curate in Lindow, a small village in Lincolnshire. He has been employed there for the last three years and considered it to be the ideal work for him. That is, until the murder took place.

Going by train to Boston they are met by an old man driving a stage coach. He takes them through the countryside to the village Lindow, some miles to the north of the town and the journey ends at the Vickarage, next to the small anglo-saxon church.
